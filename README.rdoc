= Knife Nodefu

Website:: https://github.com/brianbianco/nodefu

= DESCRIPTION:

A basic utility to help automate the creation and destruction of ec2 servers managed by chef.

= INSTALLATION:

gem install knife-nodefu

= Definitions File Directory

This file provides all the proper definitions for nodefu to be able to easily build out servers.  You can either pass in the definitions file directory with the -d option, or set the following option in your knife.rb file.

NOTE: VPC Mode is enabled when setting a Private IP

LIMITATIONS:
- Range is not supported when an Elastic IP or Private IP is set
- VPC instances require an elastic_ip_address and server_connect_attribute to be set to: public_ip_address
- VPC instances require group_ids, they don't support generated groups or aux_groups

nodefu_definitions "Path to directory"

= SUBCOMMANDS:

This plugin provides the following Knife subcommands.  Specific command options can be found by invoking the subcommand with a --help flag

== knife nodefu create

This command expects an argument in the format of <hostname><id> or <hostname>[<start_range>-<end_range>] where id is an integer.  It will automatically use the hostname as the node_spec unless you specify one with the -n option

options:

-n, --node_spec
-y, --yes
-d, --definitions_file

== knife nodefu destroy

This command expects a regular expression which it will use to search the node names.  It will then delete the client entry, node entry, and ec2 instances for those (of course not without confirmation unless you use -y)

options:

-y, --yes
-c, --skip-clients
-n, --skip-nodes
-i, --skip-instances
